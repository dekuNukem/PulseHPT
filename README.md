# User Manual

## Battery

Insert a CR2032 coin battery **positive (+) side up**.

Ensure the positive terminal is **ABOVE** the surface.

## Measurement: Hot Shoe

* Insert into hot shoe

* Slide switch to ON

* Select a speed **at or slower than 1/30s**

* Wind and release the shutter

* Result is shown

üí≠ If nothing happens, press down to ensure good contact.

‚ö†Ô∏è Beware of caveats! Read below.

#### How it works

When taking a photo, the flash sync signal activates, and remains active **until shutter is closed**.

Thus the approximate shutter speed can be measured.

#### Caveats

* Works best with earlier mostly-mechanical cameras

* Ideal for a quick check on an unknown camera

* As flash sync only fires **when shutter is fully open**, at higher shutter speeds, the measured speed can be faster than real speed.

* For most accurate result, use the light sensor method.

## PC Socket

* Use a common **PC Sync to 3.5mm Jack** Cable

* Plug into PC socket, and the other end in the tester.

* Slide switch to ON

* Select a speed **at or slower than 1/30s**

* Wind and release the shutter

* Result is shown

üí≠ If nothing happens, apply **GENTLE** pressure on the PC socket to ensure good contact.

‚ö†Ô∏è Same caveats as hot shoe!

## Light Sensor

Most accurate method as it measures light through lens directly.

* **SLOWLY and GENTLY** push the tab outwards.

* Insert the ribbon cable **metal contact side up**

* Push the tab back

## Advanced Usage



---------

The easiest way, although might be incompatible with certain cameras.

On a hotshoe, we have the middle trigger pin, and the outer ground plate:

Normally, those two pins are isolated.

However, when taking a photo, those two pins are connected together **when shutter is fully open**.

This triggers the flash, but they also **remain connected until shutter is closed**.

Thus the approximate shutter speed can be measured.
