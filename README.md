## Battery

* **CR2032**

* Positive (+) side up

* ‚ö†Ô∏è Slide UNDER the catch!

![Alt text](resources/photos/battery.jpeg)

## Measurement: Hot Shoe

* Insert into hot shoe

* Slide switch to ON

* Select a speed **within flash sync range**

* Wind and release the shutter

üí≠ If nothing happens, press down to ensure good contact.

‚ö†Ô∏è **Beware of caveats!** Read below.

![Alt text](resources/photos/title.jpeg)

#### How it works

When taking a photo, the flash sync signal activates, and remains active **until shutter is closed**.

Thus the approximate shutter speed can be measured.

#### Caveats

* Flash sync fires **only when shutter is fully open**.

* Thus at higher speeds, the measured speed can be faster than real speed.

* Works best with earlier mostly-mechanical cameras.

* For most accurate result, use the light sensor method.

## Measurement: PC Socket

* Use a common **PC socket to 3.5mm Jack** Cable

![Alt text](resources/photos/pc_cable.jpg)

* Plug into PC socket, and the other end in the tester.

* ‚ö†Ô∏è ‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure to use `X Sync` socket / option!

![Alt text](resources/photos/xm.png)

* Slide switch to ON

* Select a speed **within flash sync range**

* Wind and release the shutter

![Alt text](resources/photos/pc.jpeg)

üí≠ If nothing happens, apply **GENTLE** pressure on the PC socket to ensure good contact.

‚ö†Ô∏è Same caveats as hot shoe!

## Measurement: Light Sensor

* Most accurate
* Two Sources
	* Built-in Sensor: Easiest to Use
	* External Sensor: More Consistent Setup

## Built-in Light Sensor

This feature was added on a recent hardware revision.

Check that your tester has this option.

It should stick out on the left-hand side.

![Alt text](resources/photos/int.jpeg)

Slide light sensor source switch to `INTERAL` position.

![Alt text](resources/photos/swint.jpeg)

Shine a bright light into the sensor.

It should trigger and give a measurement.

Now you know how bright the light needs to be.

![Alt text](resources/photos/intflash.jpeg)

To test:

* Remove lens if possible
* Largest aperture otherwise
* Shine light from front
* Place tester **near the center** of film gate
* Fire shutter
	* Leaf Shutter: All Speeds
	* Focal Plane Shutter: **Within Flash Sync Speed**

## External Light Sensor

Requires more setup, but can be more consistent, and also suitable for hard-to-reach places.

* Locate the connector on **bottom-left corner**.

* **SLOWLY and GENTLY** push the black tab outwards to unlock.

![Alt text](resources/photos/tab.png)

* Insert the ribbon cable **metal contact side up** all the way in

* Push the tab back in to lock

![Alt text](resources/photos/ribbon.png)

* **Do the same** on the sensor side

![Alt text](resources/photos/sensor.jpeg)

* Slide Source Switch to `EXTERNAL`

![Alt text](resources/photos/ext.jpeg)

With light sensor connected, let's do a quick test!

* Briefly shine a bright light on the sensor

* Result will be shown

* Now you know how bright the light needs to be

![Alt text](resources/photos/test.jpeg)

Use double side tape, mount the sensor on a vertical surface, e.g. a box.

![Alt text](resources/photos/box.jpeg)

* Test **without lens** if possible
* Largest aperture otherwise
* Sensor behind shutter
* Shine light
* If possible, use Bulb mode to ensure sensor is at the **center of the light circle**.

![Alt text](resources/photos/spot.jpeg)

* Fire shutter
	* Leaf Shutter: All Speeds
	* Focal Plane Shutter: **Within Flash Sync Speed**
