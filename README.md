It can measure from three sources:

* Hot Shoe (easiest)

* PC Socket

* Light Sensor (most accurate)

## Highlights

* Compact & Portable

* Easy to Use

* Microsecond Accuracy

* Multiple Sources

## Battery Installation

Insert a CR2032 coin battery positive side up.

Ensure the positive terminal is **ABOVE** the surface.

## Hot Shoe

#### How it works

On a hotshoe, we have the middle trigger pin, and the outer ground plate:

Normally, those two pins are isolated.

However, when taking a photo, those two pins are connected together **when shutter is fully open**.

This triggers the flash, but they also **remain connected until shutter is closed**.

Thus the approximate shutter speed can be measured.

#### Instructions

Insert the tester into the hot shoe.

Turn it on.

Release the shutter

The screen should display the result.

#### Important Notes

As the hotshoe only becomes active **when shutter is fully open**, result at higher shutter speeds might be shorter than it actually is.

Therefore this way is only recommended for speed slower than 1/30 second.

Also, newer cameras might have different shutter design that does not work at all.
